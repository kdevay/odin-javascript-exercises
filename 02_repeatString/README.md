# Exercise 02 - repeatString

Write a function that simply repeats a string a given number of times:
- two arguments, `string` and `num`.


You will notice in this exercise that there are multiple tests (see in file `repeatString.spec.js`). Only the first test is currently enabled. So after making sure that this first one passes, enable the others one by one by deleting the `.skip` from the `test.skip()` function.


## Hints
- test:   npm test repeatString.spec.js

- If running `npm test repeatString.spec.js` returns results similar to the below, make sure you have enabled the rest of the tests, as described in the instructions above.

```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       6 skipped, 1 passed, 7 total
